## Overview
### Description
An app that helps you plan, track, and share the places you go. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category**: Travel
- **Mobile**: Mobile is essential for planning and documenting places on the go. As users travel to new locations, they can easily follow their planned itineraries, add newly discoverd spots to a list, view them on a map, or share these locations and their memories there via their mobile device. This app requires the user's current location, can integrate camera functionalities for the user to take pictures of the place they're at, and integrates with maps to help the user naviagate new places.
- **Story**: The instant planner, notetaker, memory storage, and sharing platform for travelers. Users can easily create itineraries, lists of places they've been, and share these lists with friends.
- **Market:** Millions of travelers around the world with iOS devices can use this app. Users don't need to be avid travelersâ€”they can even be everyday citizens living in their hometown, but they wish to plan outings in advance or share their favorite places or itineraries with friends.
- **Habit:** Users can check the app daily to see the whereabouts of their friends. They can also use the app everytime they want to and/or are going to someplace new.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to create lists of places and itineraries. V2 would allow users to share these lists and itineraries and to view others' posts in a feed. V3 would create profiles containing all the lists/itineraries for each user, which other users can view. V4 would allow the user to add notes, including photos, of the places that they've been to their lists and itineraries. This would involve bringing up the live camera in the app and storing the photos in the app. V5 would implement features such as allowing the user to selectively share who can view a certain post, local biometric authentication (touch or face ID), notifications reminding them to use the app, and auto-suggesting itineraries for the user based on parameters such as budget, duration, location preferences, etc.
